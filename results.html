									The Climate Change data shows the expected results. 
									In the folling we display the average Temperature Change for every continent decade-wise and in the following order:
									Africa, America, SouthAmerica, Asia, Europe, Oceania.
									All of those show an increasing temperatures over the past decades.

									Firstly we can observe slightly increasing temperatures (although far not as significant
									as on other continents) yet in the past decade we observe a decrease. This could be researched more extensively 
									in future studies. <br />
									Summed up in the same graphic we again observe a significant increase in temperature as expected:

								Crop Production Results
							</h2>
							<p> As we can see in the most_produced.csv file, there’s an interesting pattern. Countries from South America such as Chile, 
								Argentina and Brazil produce mainly tomatoes according to the “Major Trend” row.
								European countries and USA are experts on producing cucumbers and 
								gherkins according to the same row. (https://www.worldstopexports.com/top-cucumbers-exporting-countries/)
								The production of tomatoes in South America can be explained by the weather. 
								Tomato plants will grow in well-drained sites that receive full sun for the most of the day. 
								The top 5 exports (by value!) of cucumber are USA, Spain, Mexico, Canada and Netherlands. 
								Cucumbers are extremely susceptible to frost and 
								cold damage; the soil should be at least 70ºF (21ºC) for germination.
								This means that a country that has not a favorable climate needs to have the resources 
								to produce this vegetable. 
								That explains the presence of countries like C
								anada, Netherlands and USA in the top 5 by value.
								Of course that in certain times of the year (if not every year) the production wi
								ll be located in stoves. </p> 
								<p>
								If we change just a line of code in the file most_produced_item.py to obtain, for example, which is the most produced 
								product between meat and cereals we will observe that every country produce more cereals than meat according to the “Major Trend” row. 
								That’s a bit surprising especially in countries like Brazil and Argentina 
								which are largely known for their meat tradition.
								However there’s a logical reason.
								Cereal grain crops are grown in greater quantities and provide more food ene
								rgy worldwide than any type of crop and are therefore staple crops.
								Today, developing countries depend more on cereal grains for their nutritional needs 
								than the developed world.</p> 
								<p>
								Looking at the averager.csv we can notice a massive growth in the crop production worldwide.
								That can be explained by many factors, specially when analyzing developed countries 
								like European and North America countries.
								The development of producing techniques, the need of mass production, the population 
								growth and the recent consume needs of society certainly had a lot of influence in this growth.
								The derivative was mainly impressing in the transition of the 60s to the 70s.
								After some research we were able to discover the cause of this growth. 
								The green revolution began in the mid-20th century and consisted in the great increase in production of food grains. 
								That resulted in large part from the introduction into developing countries of new, 
								high-yielding varieties. For example, the average cereal yield has increased 175 percent since 1961. 
								This means that today the world can produce almost three times as much cereal from a 
								given area of land than it did in 1961. See image below:
								</p> 
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/averager.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
								After visualizing the ranker.csv file we can notice that United Kingdom leads the Tomato production and also the Cucumber production and are followed by Ireland. 
								Much of that mass production is for intern consumption due to the high taxes of importing to the UK. 
								Of course that being a territory with monetary resources is a must to lead the ranking. See image below:</p> 
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Ranker.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
								We also thought that would be interesting to compare the crop production of Germany, Spain 
								and Portugal since our group contains people from those 3 countries. Germany leads the 
								production of tomatoes and cucumbers, Portugal is 3rd in tomatoes production and 6th in 
								the cucumber production. Spain is 4th in tomato production and 5th in cucumber production. 
								We some similarities between the crop of Portugal and Spain that can be explained by similar climates, 
								similar economies and similar context. See image below:
